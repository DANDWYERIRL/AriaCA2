This is a simple RIA that allows the allows the user to convert inches to Cm's and cm's to inches 
it also allows the user to convert far to cel and cel to far 
It has been designed using the skeleton boiler plate and is a responsive design

My something cool in this is to swap out the standard nav menu for a drop down box once the screen is smaller than 950px
it is deployed and running at http://ariatest.apphb.com/
appharbor has been slow to show the changes i was making so if you could please allow a few hours after the test for some of the chages to be fully pushed live that
would be great
